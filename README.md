## Steps to Use the Repository

1. Clone the Repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaiRamya99/chat-bot.git
2. navigate to app.py and start the code.

## Approach
1. When a user uploads an image, the app identifies whether it's a person or garment based on user input. 
2. The images are saved and combined using the PIL library to create a composite output. 
3. Finally, the resulting image is sent back to the user, providing an interactive way to visualize how clothing would look on them.
4. From the Flask server, built the model with Python code where the bot communicates with the User.
